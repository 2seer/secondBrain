# Start a sequence Note

When notes are written with reference to an existing note, it starts a note sequence.  An initial sequence that attracts many follow-up notes easily becomes the main topic with several sub-topics over time.

By forming sequences within the slip-box, topics emerge, the future text develops, and ideas form augments that solidify your understanding.

> “Note sequences are the clusters where order merges from complexity” - Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes

1.  <mark class="hltr-green">**Click** Create a new Zettelkasten note.</mark> 
2. <mark class="hltr-green">Browse your slip-box and open an existing permanent note in a new horizontal panel.</mark>    
3. <mark class="hltr-green">Append -1 at the end of the Zettelkasten prefix of the permanent note.</mark> 

Ask yourself:
-   <mark class="hltr-green">“What ideas does this permanent note spark?”</mark> 
-   <mark class="hltr-green">“If this existing permanent note were used to write an article, what information is missing?“</mark> 
-   <mark class="hltr-green">“What does this idea remind me of that I’ve read before?”</mark> 

After thought, choose a keyword for the new permanent note and add it to the file name.
Spend an adequate amount of time writing the contents of the new permanent note.

There is no single linear path to taking permanent notes. New follow-up notes can be the result of your own thinking or sparked by other sources from your research.
