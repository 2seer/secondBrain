# Create a Fleeting Note

- Obsidian →  **today’s daily note**  
- Throughout the day capture your fleeting notes in your daily note. Fleeting notes are <mark class="hltr-blue">mere reminders of information</mark> and can be written in a variety of ways. 
- <mark class="hltr-red">Taking them should never distract you from your main work.</mark> 
- Fleeting notes also need an <mark class="hltr-blue">inbox</mark> to be reviewed. Left unprocessed, fleeting notes will become useless as their context is lost.
