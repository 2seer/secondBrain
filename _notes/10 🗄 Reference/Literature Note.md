# Create a Literature Note 

- In the Zettelkasten method, literature notes are <mark class="hltr-blue">only connected to the source</mark> from which they came, which means the literature notes you create in Obsidian <mark class="hltr-blue">require metadata</mark> . Fill out the metadata by providing the creator or <mark class="hltr-blue">author’s name</mark> as a link, add the <mark class="hltr-blue">URL of the resource</mark> , apply <mark class="hltr-blue">tags for the type</mark> , and <mark class="hltr-blue">label it as a literature-note</mark> . 
- Keep literature notes <mark class="hltr-blue">very short</mark> . Be <mark class="hltr-blue">extremely selective</mark> in what's written down. Put it in<mark class="hltr-blue"> your own words</mark> and <mark class="hltr-red">never copy</mark> unless it’s a direct quote or a reference.
- Taking these notes should not become a chore, their primary purpose is to <mark class="hltr-red">help with writing permanent notes for the slip-box</mark> , anything else is a distraction.
- Eventually, literature notes will be archived. 
- That means the ideas they contain will be lost unless something is done with them, which is why they start in your Inbox. However, once <mark class="hltr-red">translated into permanent notes</mark> , literature notes are placed <mark class="hltr-blue">in the reference system and forgotten</mark> .
