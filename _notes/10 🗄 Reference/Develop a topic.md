# Develop a topic

Luhmann would add, at most, 25 links to each of his topic notes. He’d also include short 1-2 sentences that gave an indication of what the linked permanent notes contained. <mark class="hltr-red">Topic notes</mark> also became a scratchpad for thinking, he’d place unanswered questions at the bottom to capture what pieces were missing or to contemplate the relevance to other notes.

Expand your slip-box folder and review the existing notes and note sequences.

> [!define] Create topic note 
> 1.  Identify a sequence or cluster of notes that support a common idea or argument.
> 2. Ask, <mark class="hltr-blue">“What topic would be best positioned in the middle?”</mark>.
> 3. If the index was a section in a bookstore, the topic would be the title, section, or chapter of a book within that section 
> 4. Once you have an answer, you have the name of your topic note.
> 5. Click, New note.
> 6. Give the new topic note a name that helps bridge the index to the slip-box notes.
> 7. Add the following metadata to the note:

```
index: [[indexName]] 
tags: 

#topic-note   

---
12345
```

<mark class="hltr-blue">Replace `[[indexName]]` with a link to the appropriate index note.</mark> 

Within the topic, add links to permanent notes and note sequences that support the topic. <mark class="hltr-blue">Place follow-up notes in a sequence under the starting note as a bullet list.</mark> 
The end result should start to resemble an outline or the beginning of a manuscript

In the graph view, Obsidian puts weight on notes that have the most links. To build a bottom-up visual representation of your interest, you must link the permanent notes to the lowest level possible.

Update each permanent note’s topic field with a link to the new topic note. Doing so will accurately update the weight of the topic notes in your slip-box.
