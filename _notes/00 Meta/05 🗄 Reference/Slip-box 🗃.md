# Slip-box 🗃

Daily, go through fleeting and literature notes and translate them into permanent notes, using the following process:

1. <mark class="hltr-green">Identify what’s relevant to your own research, interest, or thinking</mark>    
2. <mark class="hltr-green">Elaborate on the idea until it’s understood without its prior context</mark> 
3. <mark class="hltr-green">Connect (link) it to existing permanent notes in the slip-box</mark> 

“If you can’t say it clearly, you don’t understand it yourself.” (John Searle)
