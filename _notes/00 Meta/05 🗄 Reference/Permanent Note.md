# Permanent Note 

- <mark class="hltr-blue">Reference the existing fleeting or literature note</mark> and use it as a writing prompt to elaborate on the idea until it can be <mark class="hltr-blue">understood without its original context</mark> . Write them carefully, as if for someone else.
- Use <mark class="hltr-red">full sentences</mark> , <mark class="hltr-red">be concise</mark> , and <mark class="hltr-red">as clear as possible</mark> . Each permanent note should be <mark class="hltr-red">atomic</mark> , <mark class="hltr-red">containing only a single idea</mark> .
- Aim to have it no shorter than a tweet (180 characters) and no longer than an atomic essay (300-500 words).

# Permanent Note keyword

- Append the keyword to the note’s name after <mark class="hltr-blue">the ZettelkastenID prefix</mark> . Separate <mark class="hltr-blue">the keyword</mark> and prefix by space and a hyphen to make it more readable.
	- “Which keyword is most fitting?”
	- “In which contexts will I want to stumble upon this note in the future, even after I’ve forgotten about it?”
- Choose your keywords carefully and always assign them with an eye towards the topics you’re working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation.
- As a general rule, <mark class="hltr-blue">good keywords are normally not already mentioned as words within a note</mark>
