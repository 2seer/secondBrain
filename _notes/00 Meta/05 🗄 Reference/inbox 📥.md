 # inbox 📥

- Within one or two days move a daily note into the inbox for processing.
- <mark class="hltr-blue">Move any project-related notes to their designated folder</mark> and <mark class="hltr-blue">create permanent notes for your slip-box</mark> . Not <mark class="hltr-blue">all fleeting notes will be translated into permanent notes</mark> but too many unprocessed fleeting notes will lead to chaos.
- <mark class="hltr-blue">Once processed, archive the daily note</mark> by moving it back to the daily notes folder.
