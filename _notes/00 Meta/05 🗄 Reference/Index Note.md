[[permanent note]]

Linking is bidirectional in Obsidian, but having links on both notes makes navigation easier.
Placing permanent notes directly in the index provides them with a staging area.
As you continue to take notes, topics and sub-topics will emerge and the link to the permanent notes will be moved there instead of the index, and a link to the topic will replace them in the index under Key Topics.
